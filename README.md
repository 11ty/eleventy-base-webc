# eleventy-base-webc

A minimalist bare-bones Eleventy-official starter project useful for demos/experiments with [WebC](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/webc/) and the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) site generator (using the [v2.0 release](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/eleventy-v2/)).

## Features

* [Eleventy WebC plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/webc/) preconfigured:
	* Includes the [`<is-land>` WebC component](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/partial-hydration/) ready for use.
	* Add your own `*.webc` files to the `_components` folder.
* Adds a [`javascript` front matter type](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-frontmatter-customize/#example-use-javascript-in-your-front-matter) for arbitrary JS front matter.
* Simple WebC Eleventy Layout file with streamlined critical CSS and JS bundles (`_includes/layouts/base.webc`)
